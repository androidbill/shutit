//
//   * a shared output chain, so sounds sit in one space instead of arriving dry and
//     separate — a compressor keeps a stacked chord from clipping, and a short
//     synthesised room stops every note sounding like a test tone;
//   * real envelopes, so notes are plucked and knocks are struck rather than switched
//     on and off;
//   * a pentatonic scale for everything musical, so two cues landing together — a
//     payout while somebody else's turn arrives — can never sound wrong.
//
// The dice are the one sound built to imitate something specific, and they are worth the
// detail: a die roll is not a noise burst, it is a scatter of little wooden knocks that
// slows down and then stops. See `sfx.dice`.

//
// It is not enough on its own, though: a resume() called from here, or from inside

// and a context a phone has actually gone and suspended for real (not just "interrupted",
// which this same call does recover) can refuse to leave that state for anything less —
// which is exactly the case that needed the app fully closed and reopened to fix. Almost
// none of this game's sounds are played from the tap that caused them in the first place
// (see reactToLog: they follow the shared log arriving back from the server, well outside
// whatever gesture triggered the move), so the sound system as a whole is only ever as
// alive as the last time a real tap landed somewhere. Watching every tap in the app, not
